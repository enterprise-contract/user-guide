= Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline, Enterprise Contract, and SLSA

.Overview
****

Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline is a build and CI/CD system
that aims to meet or exceed https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels[SLSA Build L3 (v1.0)].
Enterprise Contract is an
https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts[artifact verifier] and
customizable policy checker designed to be easily integrated with RHTAP's CI/CD
workflows.

A lot of the default policies created for RHTAP and enforced by EC are closely
related to SLSA requirements, based on both the recent SLSA v1.0, and the older
SLSA v0.1 specification. In this documentation we'll describe in more detail
how RHTAP and EC work together to provide a high standard of supply chain
security, informed and guided by the link:https://slsa.dev/[SLSA
specifications].

== SLSA Requirements

=== SLSA requirements verified explicitly by Enterprise Contract

Enterprise Contract comes with a set of policy rules designed for use with
RHTAP. Using EC to verify that a build passes all the checks defined by the
policy provides a high level of confidence that the build was built securely
and can be trusted.

Many of the policy rules are linked to specific SLSA requirements, for example:

|===
|SLSA reference|EC policy rule|Notes

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#scripted-build[Scripted build (v0.1)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_build_scripted_build__build_script_used[Build task contains steps]
a| RHTAP uses link:https://tekton.dev/[Tekton] so knowing that is enough to consider this requirement satisfied, however this specific
rule confirms it explicitly for each build. The rule asserts that the attestation includes details about the pipeline run that created the build,
that the specific task run that pushed the image is identifiable, and that information about each steps in that task run are present.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#build-service[Build service (v0.1)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_build_build_service__slsa_builder_id_found[SLSA Builder ID found]
a| This check aims to confirm the basic requirement from the v0.1 SLSA spec that the build ran on a build service. Once again, any build created
by RHTAP is expected to meet this requirement, but the rule confirms this by verifying that that a builder is present in the SLSA attestation. The SLSA
Builder ID is also key part of the link:https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts] process
described in SLSA v1.0.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#hermetic[Hermetic Builds (v0.1)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#hermetic_build_task__build_task_hermetic[Build task called with hermetic param set]
a| This rule verifies that the build task was called with a particular parameter specifying the build should be done hermeticly. This rule is specific
to RHTAP's task definitions, since EC isn't able to explicitly confirm that the build was indeed hermetic. But, when combined with the strictest
"acceptable task bundles" rule, and a trustable source for the task definition, we can use the rule to ensure that only builds performed hermeticly can
be released.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_build_build_service__slsa_builder_id_accepted[SLSA Builder ID is known and accepted]
a| The verification process described in the SLSA v1.0 spec includes a check to confirm the builder id matches what is
expected. This rule will fail if an unexpected builder id is found in the SLSA attestation. (For RHTAP currently the builder id
is the default used by Tekton Chains, though this may change in the future.)

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats#f-upload-modified-package[Threat (G) - Upload modified package],
https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats#h-use-compromised-package[Threat (H) - Use compromised package] (v1.0)
a| Image signature check passed
a| Enterprise Contract uses a public key to validate the signature of the image using https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/[Cosign]. If the image
signature can't be verified for any reason, a failure will be reported. There are other ways to verify image signatures, e.g. by using `cosign` directly,
but EC will happily do it for you.

There is also experimental support in EC for validating signatures for images signed keylessly
using https://docs.sigstore.dev/fulcio/overview/[Sigstore Fulcio], though RHTAP currently uses long-lived
signing keys to sign images and attestations.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| Attestation signature check passed
a| As well as verifying the image signature, EC also verifies the signature of the attestation, which is an important part of the artifact
verification process. For RHTAP the same key is used to sign the attestation and the image itself. As mentioned above, there is experimental
support for verifying keylessly signed attestations.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_build_scripted_build__subject_build_task_matches[Provenance subject matches build task image result]
a| SLSA recommends an artifact verifier checks that the provenance statement’s subject matches the digest of the artifact in question.
This is a good sanity check to confirm that the provenance being considered is for the expected image. Because EC uses Cosign under the hood, and
Cosign does this check as part of its signature verification, we get this confirmed automatically. The EC rule linked here performs an additional
confirmation by comparing the image reference produced by the build task and confirming that also matches the provenance subject.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_provenance_available__attestation_predicate_type_accepted[Expected attestation predicate type found]
a| SLSA suggests that the predicate type in the artifact's provenance should be `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1`. This rule confirms that requirement,
and will fail if the predicate type is found to be any other value.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#provenance_materials__git_clone_source_matches_provenance[Git clone source matches materials provenance]
a| This is a good sanity check related to artifact verification that isn't specifically mentioned in the SLSA guidelines. In RHTAP build pipelines the
git clone task provides information about the git repo and the commit sha used. This rule confirms that the url and the commit sha from the git clone
task match what appears in the "materials" provenance.

=== SLSA requirements not explicitly verified by Enterprise Contract

There are numerous SLSA Build requirements that are met by Red Hat Trusted
Application Pipeline, but not explicitly verifiable with an Enterprise Contract
policy rule. We won't go into depth in this document, but for example:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|SLSA reference|RHTAP response

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l2-hosted-build-platform[Build L2: Hosted build platform]
a| Due to its design, its architecture, and operational management, the Red Hat Trusted Application
Pipeline, meets these requirements implicitly. And, as we've seen above, the Enterprise Contract
can be used to verify the authenticity of the signed provenances.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l3-hardened-builds[Build L3: Hardened builds]
a| For example, the RHTAP's Tekton environment prevents different build pipelines from influencing each
other, and has secure access polices and management practices for signing secrets and other credentials.

////
In future there may be some RHTAP system level docs addressing this in more detail.
Linking to a general system overview of RHTAP would also be useful here also I think.

== Notes and caveats

Because EC was designed initially for use with RHTAP, and RHTAP uses Tekton
CI/CD, many of the specific rules mentioned above are currently Tekton specific
in that they use details about the Tekton pipeline run, which are currently
made available in the SLSA attestation created by Tekton Chains.

This is not a limitation of EC itself, but rather just an attribute of the
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc[policies created for RHTAP] in their
current state. In future we're aiming to extract the Tekton specific rules from
the general SLSA rules to make the rules more generally applicable. We expected
that policy rules for build systems not based on Tekton and Tekton Chains could
be created easily.

Note also that since EC can conveniently apply any policy defined in
https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/[OPA/Rego], it is
able to be used for a wide range of purposes, e.g. to verify certain tests were
run and passed, and to apply any business specific release policies. Browse the
rules defined in xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc[Policies] to see
what other rules have been defined for use by RHTAP within Red Hat.

== Conclusion

Enterprise Contract can be used as a convenient and customizable SLSA artifact
verifier. It's doing that now within RHTAP, and we think it's capable and
flexible enough to become a part of other build systems where supply chain security
is a priority.
