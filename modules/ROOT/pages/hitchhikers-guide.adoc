= Hitchhiker's Guide to Enterprise Contract

The Enterprise Contract can be used to validate a software artifact, e.g. a container image, that
has already been signed and attested. This document assumes you do not have such an artifact. It
walks you through the process of signing and attesting a container image, then how to use EC to
validate those operations.

== Required Tooling

Before starting, the following tooling is required:

* https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#installation[cosign]
* https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/user-guide/main/cli.html[ec cli]
* https://github.com/containers/skopeo[skopeo] or
  https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/crane[crane]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/[docker] or https://podman.io/[podman] (optional)

== Container Repository

During this guide, image signatures and attestations will be pushed to the container repository
where the image resides. Using a local registry is ideal for testing purposes. If you have a
container runtime installed, e.g. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/[docker] or
https://podman.io/[podman], you can start one with ease:

[source, bash]
----
docker run -it -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
# or with podman:
# podman run -it -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
----

Alternatively, if you have access to a repository in an existing registry, e.g. quay.io or
docker.io, then you can just use that.

Set the shell variable `REPOSITORY` accordingly:

[source, bash]
----
REPOSITORY='localhost:5000/ec-zero-to-hero'
----

== Container Image

Before signing and attesting an image, we need... well... a container image! Any image will do. You
can use the ec-cli image if you need one, `quay.io/enterprise-contract/ec-cli:latest`.

Let's copy the image to our test repository. This can be done with a tool such as
https://github.com/containers/skopeo[skopeo] or
https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/crane[crane]:

[source, bash]
----
crane copy quay.io/enterprise-contract/ec-cli:latest "$REPOSITORY:latest"
# or with skopeo:
# skopeo copy docker://quay.io/enterprise-contract/ec-cli:latest \
#  "docker://$REPOSITORY:latest" --dest-tls-verify=false
# NOTE: Only set `--dest-tls-verify=false` if you are using a local registry.
----

== Generate Signing Key

In order to sign and attest the image, we need a signing key.

[source, bash]
----
cosign generate-key-pair
----

Enter a new password for the key-pair on the password prompt. For the purpose of this guide, use
something memorable like `top-secret`. Otherwise, always use a strong secret password.

The command should generate two files in the currently working directory. `cosign.pub` is the public
key. We will use this later during verification. This can, and should, be distributed freely to
anyone that may want to verify the image. `cosign.key` is the private key. This is used for signing
content. Treat this like the password you provided. No one other than the entity responsible for
singing and attestating images should have access to this.

== Signing the Image

We use `cosign` to sign our image.

[source, bash]
----
cosign sign --key cosign.key $REPOSITORY:latest
----

Enter the key-pair password and `y` to upload a transaction record to the public instance of
https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/[Rekor] hosted by the https://www.sigstore.dev/[Sigstore]
project.

== Attesting the Image

Next, let's use `cosign` again to associate a SLSA Provenance attestion to the image.

Usually, the software delivery service responsible for building the container image is also
responsible for providing the SLSA Provenance attestation. Here, we will use an example one instead.

First, create the content of the SLSA Provenance:

[source, bash]
----
echo '{
  "builder": {
    "id": "https://localhost/dummy-id"
  },
  "buildType": "https://localhost/dummy-type",
  "invocation": {},
  "buildConfig": {},
  "metadata": {
    "buildStartedOn": "2023-09-25T16:26:44Z",
    "buildFinishedOn": "2023-09-25T16:28:59Z",
    "completeness": {
      "parameters": false,
      "environment": false,
      "materials": false
    },
    "reproducible": false
  },
  "materials": []
}
' > predicate.json
----

Now, create an attestation and attach it to the container image.

[source, bash]
----
cosign attest --predicate predicate.json --type slsaprovenance --key cosign.key "$REPOSITORY:latest"
----

As done while signing the image, enter the key-pair password and `y` to upload a transaction record
to the same https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/[Rekor] instance.

== Quick Check

At this point, the command `cosign tree` should detect the image has one signature and one
attestation.

[source, bash]
----
$ cosign tree "$REPOSITORY:latest"
📦 Supply Chain Security Related artifacts for an image: localhost:5000/ec-zero-to-hero:latest
└── 💾 Attestations for an image tag: localhost:5000/ec-zero-to-hero:sha256-b5430d3d447434c795a508036e5046e41c009039be5b3f656f121c2426500d1e.att

----

We are ready to verify the image with the Enterprise Contract CLI!

== Basic Verification

The most basic verification that can be done with the EC cli is to verify the image has a signature
and a SLSA Provenance attestation matching a given public key.

[source, bash]
----
ec validate image --public-key cosign.pub --image "$REPOSITORY:latest" --policy ''
----

The command should succeed and it should generate a report.

The `--output` flag can be used to display the report in different formats and also to write it to a
file instead of stdout. It can be used multiple times to generate different types of reports. The
flag `--show-successes` adds to the report all the checks that succeeded. `--info` displays a little
more information for each check, e.g. the solution for a certain violation.

== Using a policy

In the previous section, we used `--policy ''`. This means no checks other than the basic signature
checks were performed. Let's create a new policy to make things more interesting.

First, we create a new https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/[rego] file to
define a new policy rule:

[source, bash]
----
echo 'package zero_to_hero

import future.keywords.contains
import future.keywords.if
import future.keywords.in


# METADATA
# title: Builder ID
# description: Verify the SLSA Provenance has the builder.id set to
#   the expected value.
# custom:
#   short_name: builder_id
#   failure_msg: The builder ID %q is not the expected %q
#   solution: >-
#     Ensure the correct build system was used to build the container
#     image.
deny contains result if {
	some attestation in input.attestations
	attestation.statement.predicateType == "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2"

	expected := "https://localhost/dummy-id"
	got := attestation.statement.predicate.builder.id

	expected != got

	result := {
		"code": "zero_to_hero.builder_id",
		"msg": sprintf("The builder ID %q is not expected, %q", [got, expected])
	}
}
' > rules.rego
----

The above contains a single policy rule that ensure the `builder.id` in the SLSA Provenance matches
the expected value.

The `METADATA` comment block is rego's way to specify
https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#metadata[annotations] for rules. EC
leverages this in order to provide additional information in its report, see
https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/ec-policies/authoring.html#_rule_annotations[here].

`input` is a rego object that holds all the information about the image, its signature, and its
attestations. Its contents are defined
https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/ec-cli/main/policy_input.html[here]. It is also possible to save
this object to a JSON file which is useful when writing new policy rules. To do so, use the
`policy-input` output, e.g. `ec validate image ... --output policy-input`.

Next, we create a policy configuration that uses this rule.

[source, bash]
----
echo "
---
sources:
  - policy:
      - $(pwd)/rules.rego
" > policy.yaml
----

This policy configuration references the rules by file name, which have to be absolute paths. This
is useful for testing and development of rules. Referencing rules in a git repository or in an OCI
registry are better suited for most other use cases. The
https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/ec-cli/main/configuration.html[docs] on policy configuration
explain this concept further.

Finally, let's use this policy in our validation and also use the previously mentioned flags to
display additional information in the report.

[source, bash]
----
ec validate image --public-key cosign.pub --image "$REPOSITORY:latest" --policy policy.yaml \
    --show-successes --info --output yaml
----

That should succeed and the newly added rule should appear in the list of successes.

If we change the expected value in `rules.rego`, validation should fail and the report should
include a violation, e.g.:

[source, yaml]
----
violations:
  - metadata:
      code: zero_to_hero.builder_id
      description: Verify the SLSA Provenance has the builder.id set to the expected value.
      solution: Ensure the correct build system was used to build the container image.
      title: Builder ID
    msg: The builder ID "https://localhost/dummy-id" is not expected, "https://localhost/not-dummy-id"
----

== Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this high level overview of the Enterprise Contract. You are now officially an EC
Hero!

By the way, once you are done experimenting, it is a good idea to tear down the local container
registry and remove the cosign key-pair:

[source, bash]
----
docker rm --force registry  # or podman rm --force registry
rm cosign.key cosign.pub
----
