= Getting started with Enterprise Contract & Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline

This guide describes creating a new application, creating an integration test
to run the Enterprise Contract, examining its results, and customizing the
Enterprise Contract configuration.

The screenshots and example output are based on real sample application created
on the current (March 28, 2023) "beta" version of RHTAP.

IMPORTANT: Please see the important notes xref::index.adoc[here].

== Creating an application

Visit the following url:

- https://console.redhat.com/beta/hac/stonesoup

.Main home page for RHTAP
image::e5e0649bef55946c51024076772bb941.png[]

NOTE: Presumably in the near future the url will be changed so it no longer
refers to the `stonesoup` code name, and also the title "CI/CD" might be
changed to Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline or RHTAP.

Click on "+ Create an application".

.Create application form
image::a2881d0be7b18acc6dec6b5e0558174c.png[]

Choose an application name and add the GitHub url for your project. In this
example a NodeJS sample app was used, specifically
link:https://github.com/simonbaird/devfile-sample[this one], and the
application name was left as the default value, `my-app`.

.Application creation screen

.Configuring components
image::641d165592d5e23c6ff37eafa608697c.png[]

"Custom Build" is needed to run the tests that Enterprise Contract expects to
see, so chose "Custom build". Unless you have the GitHub Application installed
already you should reach this screen.

Clicking "Install GitHub Application" leads to the GitHub application
permissions screen.

.GitHub application install

Trying to create the pull request again:

.Pull request created
image::babfa40534d85e2aac76f7f352ba3a1d.png[]

Looking at the pull request:

.Pull request in GitHub
image::d8e53405b5b95d99d2569574c777b071.png[]

After merging the PR, the UI updates to show that it was merged:

.Upgraded to custom build
image::f555aa90630e887aa3c5fb757666a694.png[]

A build is triggered by the merge:

.Initial build started
image::1a3e631c2d19eef09fe15c8fa89ea65e.png[]

A short time later the build is complete:

.Initial build complete
image::e98385fa1da51a13cb151abdaad52577.png[]

NOTE: All of the above is a pretty standard guide to creating an application
with RHTAP, so it might be already covered by other documentation. Potentially
it could be removed from this page entirely and this particular guide could
start from the next section.


== Adding an Integration Test to run Enterprise Contract

NOTE: In future this step might not be required since a
default `IntegrationTestScenario` will be automatically created and
presumably visible in the "Integration Tests" tab. See
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HACBS-1616[HACBS-1616] for details.

Click the "Integration Tests" tab:

.Integration tests tab
image::b7de9674683e9ddae5fba10bae8e0907.png[]


Click "Add Integration Test":

.Adding an Integration Test
image::cfa8548dfe7a9082ab9eefa83cdbb2af.png[]

Fill in the details as follows:

Integration test name:: Use whatever you like for the name. I called mine `check-contract`

Image bundle:: Should be `quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract:devel`

Pipeline to run:: Should be `enterprise-contract` since that is the name of the pipeline definition in the Tekton bundle specified above.

Optional for release:: Leave this unchecked to indicate that you don't want to
release anything that is failing the Enterprise Contract policy check.

TIP: The source for the Tekton pipeline defined in that bundle is
link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/blob/main/pipelines/enterprise-contract.yaml[here
in the build-definitions repo]. The source the the Tekton task used by that pipeline is
link:https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-cli/blob/main/tasks/verify-enterprise-contract/0.1/verify-enterprise-contract.yaml[here
in the ec-cli repo].

TIP: If you prefer to pin the pipeline bundle to a particular version, instead of using the `devel` tag, use one of the pinned tags
link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract?tab=tags[visible here].
Note that the name of the tag matches a commit sha in the link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions[build-definitions repo].
You could also use a container image digest to pin it more securely.

NOTE: In the near future it will be possible to use a git resolver to specify
the pipeline definition instead of the tekton bundle image ref. It's expected
that will become the preferred way to specify the pipeline. These docs should
be updated to demonstrate that as soon as the git resolved is available.

With the fields populated, hit the "Add Integration Test" button:

.Ready to create
image::dac148d6b4becf41377865581ecbd1dd.png[]

.After creation
image::988492c60644c1a33e81fde03def8a1c.png[]

== Running the newly created Integration Test

NOTE: As far as I know there's currently no way to trigger the new Integration
Test other than by pushing a new commit to the application component's source
repo, which triggers a full rebuild of the component. It would be nice if it
were possible to manually trigger this pipeline, especially when experimenting
with different Enterprise Contract policies.

To trigger a rebuild, make a commit in the GitHub repo for the component.
(link:https://github.com/simonbaird/devfile-sample/commit/e9913e9c4faa4a6a2168d605b73029af5d2db4d9[Here
is mine].)

This should trigger a new build-pipeline, and when that's done, the newly
created Integration Test pipeline should be triggered.

You can find the pipeline runs under the "Pipeline Runs" tab after clicking on
the integration test.

.The Integration Test pipeline run
image::943596175af7d0f1cf533f4d31ddbd4c.png[]

NOTE: I was expecting this to pass. The failure is due to a known bug with the
clair test, see
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STONEINTG-373[STONEINTG-373]. Rather than
wait for the fix to be merged, I'll use the opportunity to demonstrate
customizing the Enterprise Contract configuration to skip this known false
positive.

From the logs we can see the reason for the failure:

.TaskRun logs
image::d4a840b42b5d226093d21c48943df295.png[]

Extracting the specific part of the output, we can see it's the
`cve.missing_cve_scan_results` rule that's failed.

[,yaml]
----
violations:
- metadata:
    code: cve.missing_cve_scan_results
    collections:
    - minimal
    description: The clair-scan task results have not been found in the SLSA Provenance
      attestation of the build pipeline.
    effective_on: "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    title: Missing CVE scan results
  msg: CVE scan results not found
----

Even though the result was unexpected, we now have an integration test that
will run the Enterprise Contract check every time there's a new build.

In the next section we'll take a closer look at the default Enterprise Contract
configuration, and what steps are required to modify it.


== Inspecting the Enterprise Contract results

Let's take a closer look at the output produced by the Enterprise Contract and
the configuration it used.

=== Command line credentials

We want to access the cluster using `kubectl` or `oc`, so let's get some credentials to allow that.

The link to get a token is link:https://registration-service-toolchain-host-operator.apps.stone-stg-host1.hjvn.p1.openshiftapps.com/[this one].
Authenticate, then click the "Proxy login command" link in the top right.

NOTE: Will it always be that url? Is there some way to discover what the URL is in case you don't know it in advance?

.Copying the 'oc login --token...' command
image::1905b130f55b1c3fa72b310ce0bd8ce3.png[]

Paste the login command in your terminal and you should logged in to the cluster.

[,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc login --token=__<very-long-token>__ --server=__<server-url>__
Logged into "https://api-toolchain-host-operator.apps.stone-stg-host1.hjvn.p1.openshiftapps.com:443" as "sbaird" using the token provided.

You have one project on this server: "sbaird-tenant"

Using project "sbaird-tenant".
----

NOTE: This token expires in a unexpectedly short amount of time, so you may
need to do this repeatedly.

NOTE: Would it be possible to adjust timeout longer, perhaps an hour instead of
whatever it is now? It feels like it's currently five or ten minutes. There is a
link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hFvQDH1H6MGNqTGfcZpyl2h8OIaynP8sokZohCS0Su0/edit#heading=h.cs6a0cjzoq2d[workaround
suggestion here] FWIW.

Here are some commands to extract the Enterprise Contract output. These
commands works conveniently if the integration test is the most recent
PipelineRun, but it should be easy enough to adapt the commands as required if
that is not the case.

[,bash]
----
PR_NAME=$( kubectl get pipelinerun -o name --sort-by='.status.startTime' | tail -1 )
POD_NAME=$( kubectl get $PR_NAME -o yaml | yq .status.taskRuns.[].status.podName )
kubectl logs -c step-validate $POD_NAME
----

NOTE: If you need to install `yq` follow the instructions
link:https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/#install[here].

NOTE: Perhaps there a simpler, easier way to access the TaskRun log. Copying
the raw logs from the web UI would be an alternative way to do it, but for now
I'm trying to use command lines that are easy to copy/paste.

[NOTE]
====
I thought it would be possible to use `tkn` here, but I get an error,
perhaps because the pipeline definition is not visible. Is that expected?

[,bash]
----
$ tkn pr logs my-app-qcrsw-5pwk6
Error: pipelines.tekton.dev "enterprise-contract" not found
----
====

The EC output is YAML so you can select pieces of it using the `yq` command. For
example, this produces a list of the violations:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl logs -c step-validate $POD_NAME | yq .components.[].violations
- metadata:
    code: cve.missing_cve_scan_results
    collections:
      - minimal
    description: The clair-scan task results have not been found in the SLSA Provenance attestation of the build pipeline.
    effective_on: "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    title: Missing CVE scan results
  msg: CVE scan results not found
----

To create a custom configuration for EC, it's useful to extract the
configuration being used currently, i.e. the default configuration.

Let's do that as follows:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl logs -c step-validate $POD_NAME | yq .policy > ec-policy.yml
$ cat ec-policy.yml
----

[,yaml]
----
configuration:
  include:
    - "@minimal"
  exclude:
    - step_image_registries
description: |
  Use the policy rules from the "minimal" collection. This and other
  collections are defined in
  https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.stonesoup.io/ec-policies/release_policy.html#_available_rule_collections
  The minimal collection is a small set of policy rules that should be easy to pass for brand new RHTAP users. If a different policy configuration is desired, this resource can serve as a starting point. See the docs on how to include and exclude rules https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.stonesoup.io/ec-policies/policy_configuration.html#_including_and_excluding_rules
publicKey: k8s://tekton-chains/public-key
sources:
  - data:
      - oci::quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-policy-data:git-d995f67@sha256:eb713f2c0d9c944cbbb298a2c8a0ca1e5a741d149f033b145296d6f550ebd10b
    name: Release Policies
    policy:
      - oci::quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-release-policy:git-d995f67@sha256:9d2cffae5ed8a541b4bff1acbaa9bb0b42290214de969e515e78f97b8cf8ff51
----

TIP: The default EC policies for RHTAP are defined
link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/infra-deployments/blob/main/components/enterprise-contract/ecp.yaml[here in the infra-deployments repo].

[TIP]
====
For verifying image and attestation signatures the public key is useful. We can
extract that from the output also like this:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl logs -c step-validate $POD_NAME | yq .key > rhtap-signing-key.pub
----

This method of extracting the public key is probably easier than the methods
described in xref::cosign.adoc[here] and xref::custom-data.adoc[here]. If we
think this is acceptable as the preferred method we should revise those docs.
====

=== The IntegrationTestScenario record

Let's also look at the IntegrationTestScenario record. This is the record that
corresponds to the integration test visible under the "Integration Tests" tab.
In this example it's called `check-contract`.

Listing all the IntegrationTestScenario records:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl get integrationtestscenario
NAME             APPLICATION
check-contract   my-app

$ kubectl get integrationtestscenario check-contract -o yaml | yq '.metadata |= {"name":.name,"namespace":.namespace}'
----

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationTestScenario
metadata:
  name: check-contract
  namespace: sbaird-tenant
spec:
  application: my-app
  bundle: quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract:devel
  contexts:
    - description: Application testing
      name: application
  pipeline: enterprise-contract
status:
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-03-29T22:06:32Z"
      message: Integration test scenario is Valid.
      reason: Valid
      status: "True"
      type: IntegrationTestScenarioValid
----

NOTE: Notice the `bundle` and the `pipeline` values which were initially
entered via the UI. Later we'll be modifying this record to add some params
that will be passed to the integration test pipeline.

NOTE: In the above example we're filtering out the majority of the metadata
since it's not particularly interesting or relevant for this documentation.

== Customizing the Enterprise Contract

=== Creating a custom ECP record

We'll start with the same configuration as the default ECP and then modify it.

Create a stub yaml file call `ecp.yml` with the following content:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: EnterpriseContractPolicy
metadata:
  name: ec-policy
----

We'll add the default configuration with some yq commands. (You could also do
this manually with a text editor.)

The `ec-policy.yml` file is the one we produced earlier with `kubectl logs -c
step-validate $POD_NAME | yq .policy > ec-policy.yml`. The data in that file
will be placed under the `spec` key.

[,bash]
----
cat ecp.yml | yq ".spec |= $(yq ec-policy.yml -ojson -I0)" > my-ec-policy.yml
cat my-ec-policy.yml
----

Let's edit the new `my-ec-policy.yml` file. Modify the description and add
an `exclude` option designed to skip all the `cve` rules. After editing the
`my-ec-policy.yml` file it should look like this:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: EnterpriseContractPolicy
metadata:
  name: ec-policy
spec:
  configuration:
    include:
      - "@minimal"
    exclude:
      - step_image_registries
      - cve.*
  description: |-
    Skips the cve rule due to a known bug in the clair test task.
  publicKey: k8s://tekton-chains/public-key
  sources:
    - data:
        - oci::quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-policy-data:git-d995f67@sha256:eb713f2c0d9c944cbbb298a2c8a0ca1e5a741d149f033b145296d6f550ebd10b
      name: Release Policies
      policy:
        - oci::quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-release-policy:git-d995f67@sha256:9d2cffae5ed8a541b4bff1acbaa9bb0b42290214de969e515e78f97b8cf8ff51
----

Now create this CR in your namespace:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl apply -f my-ec-policy.yml
enterprisecontractpolicy.appstudio.redhat.com/ec-policy configured
----

The next step is to modify the IntegrationTestScenario record to tell it to use
that configuration.

NOTE: I didn't really explain why I chose `cve.*` to exclude. The reason is
that I wanted to skip all the rules in the
link:https://enterprise-contract.github.io/ec-policies/release_policy.html#cve_package["cve"
package]. Skipping just `cve.missing_cve_scan_results` might have also worked.

=== Modifying the IntegrationTestScenario record

We need to add a parameter called POLICY_CONFIGURATION that will be used when
the Integration Test pipeline is started. I'll use `yq` and `kubectl apply` to
do that:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl get IntegrationTestScenario check-contract -o yaml | yq '.spec.params |= [{"name":"POLICY_CONFIGURATION","value":"ec-policy"}]' | kubectl apply -f -
----

NOTE: I get a warning using `kubectl apply` like this, since the original CR
doesn't have the annotations that the apply command expects to see. Is there a
more standard way to patch a CR that would avoid the warning? Using `kubectl
edit IntegrationTestScenario check-contract` would work here, but it's a little
harder to document clearly.

NOTE: It would be nice if this could be done via the web UI. Perhaps in future
there could be a way to set or modify params for any IntegrationTestScenario
via the UI.

Taking a look at the modified IntegrationTestScenario spec:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl get IntegrationTestScenario check-contract -o yaml | yq .spec
----

[,yaml]
----
application: my-app
bundle: quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract:devel
contexts:
  - description: Application testing
    name: application
params:
  - name: POLICY_CONFIGURATION
    value: ec-policy
pipeline: enterprise-contract
----

Notice that the value of the `POLICY_CONFIGURATION` param that we just added is
"ec-policy" which is the name of our custom ECP CR. The following command
should display the ECP CR that we created earlier:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl get EnterpriseContractPolicy ec-policy -o yaml
----

At this point we are ready to re-run the Integration Test with the customized EC policy.

== Re-running EC with the customized policy

To re-run the Integration Test we need to trigger a build. As before, we'll do
that by making a commit in the source repo. (For my example I'm again
link:https://github.com/simonbaird/devfile-sample/commit/2edbaceb46dfa0ca396017d2b1000acfffe7f68e[commiting]
directly to main branch via the GitHub web UI.)

The commit triggers a new build as expected.

.New Build running
image::e0e2e21b85c6de07ecca12d297fb03a6.png[]

Notice that "Tests" is still marked as failing.

Once the build is finished, the Integration Test is triggered and this time it's green:

.Integration Test passing
image::a3ae12d95c63c572285c5d42f24dc75e.png[]

Let's confirm that it's working as expected. Firstly, if we view the
Integration Test and click the "Pipeline Runs" tab, we can see the new pipline run.

.Integration Test pipeline runs
image::45a7d7b201b4cd49b7f47f8b388fc533.png[]

If we take a look at the logs we can see that the overall `success` value is
`true` and that the customized configuration was used.

.Enterprise Contract task logs
image::775c93da5e37035e14fa6629d3c2a876.png[]

== Using the full set of policies

The `minimal` collection is a subset of all the rules defined by Enterprise
Contract. The default ECP uses the minimal collection because it's likely to be
passing for new applications.

To wrap up this guide, let's modify the configuration again to configure the
Integration Test to run the full set of all EC rules and examine the result.

=== Modifying the customized ECP again

You can use `kubectl edit` if you like, but I'll do the yq modify again like this:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl get EnterpriseContractPolicy ec-policy -o yaml  | yq '.spec.configuration |= {"include":["*"]}' | kubectl apply -f -

$ kubectl get EnterpriseContractPolicy ec-policy -o yaml  | yq '.spec.description |= "Include all rules"' | kubectl apply -f -

$ kubectl get EnterpriseContractPolicy ec-policy -o yaml | yq .spec
----

[,yaml]
----
configuration:
  include:
    - '*'
description: Include all rules
publicKey: k8s://tekton-chains/public-key
sources:
  - data:
      - oci::quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-policy-data:git-d995f67@sha256:eb713f2c0d9c944cbbb298a2c8a0ca1e5a741d149f033b145296d6f550ebd10b
    name: Release Policies
    policy:
      - oci::quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-release-policy:git-d995f67@sha256:9d2cffae5ed8a541b4bff1acbaa9bb0b42290214de969e515e78f97b8cf8ff51
----

NOTE: "All rules" here means effectively all the rules defined in the
`quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-release-policy` bundle which is defined under
`sources`. Those rules are described link:https://enterprise-contract.github.io/ec-policies/release_policy.html[here].
You can also write your own custom rules but we don't have good documentation
for that yet. If you want some pointers, feel free to ask questions on the
`#stonesoup-users` Red Hat slack channel.

NOTE: Setting `configuration` to just `{}` would also work to apply all the
rules, but I think using an include with a wildcard helps express the intention
better.

You could also select the minimal plus the three SLSA level collections by
setting the configuration like this:

[,yaml]
----
...
  include:
    - "@minimal"
    - "@slsa1"
    - "@slsa2"
    - "@slsa3"
...
----

NOTE: Beware that the SLSA collection rules are currently based on the v0.1 of the
SLSA spec, which is a little different to the recently updated SLSA v1.0 draft.
See link:https://enterprisecontract.dev/ec-policies/release_policy.html#_available_rule_collections[these docs]
for information on what rules are included in each collection.

=== Triggering another build

There's no need to modify the IntegrationTestScenario record now, since it's already pointing to our customized ECP CR.

Trigger a new build by making a commit in the source repo once again.

.The new build running
image::26ccaa4bfcd422ebe86ca01688fe58aa.png[]

With all the rules enabled, I'm expecting the Integration Test to be failing again.

As expected:

.The new failing test
image::cb7c8b8d5cda3fc2a94adc8e733b80bc.png[]

Let's extract all the failures on the command line:

[,bash]
----
$ PR_NAME=$( kubectl get pipelinerun -o name --sort-by='.status.startTime' | tail -1 )
$ POD_NAME=$( kubectl get $PR_NAME -o yaml | yq .status.taskRuns.[].status.podName )
$ kubectl logs -c step-validate $POD_NAME | yq .components.[].violations.[].msg
----

----
Pipeline task 'build-container' uses an unacceptable task bundle 'quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah:0.1@sha256:c3712257615d206ef40013bf1c5c681670fc8f7fd6aac9fa4c86f7afeff627ef'
Pipeline task 'init' uses an unacceptable task bundle 'quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-init:0.1@sha256:5ce77110e2a49407a69a7922042dc0859f7e8f5f75dc0cd0bcc2d17860469bdb'
CVE scan results not found
Build task was not invoked with hermetic parameter
Required task "prefetch-dependencies" is missing
Required task "sast-snyk-check" is missing
Test "clair-scan" did not complete successfully
Test "sanity-label-check" did not complete successfully
----

We can also look at warnings and successes, for example:

[,bash]
----
$ kubectl logs -c step-validate $POD_NAME | yq .components.[].warnings
$ kubectl logs -c step-validate $POD_NAME | yq .components.[].successes
----

NOTE: Describing how to debug and fix all these EC violations is left for
another day.

NOTE: Of all the errors listed above, the "unacceptable task bundle" seems the
most unintuitive, so we may need some specific documentation describing
the acceptable bundle concepts.
